# OpenGrid
OpenGrid is a simple tool to orchestrate open improvisations for a group of musicians, with some timing and cueing controls. You can try it here: https://michaeldessen.github.io/OpenGrid/

## How to use

### Players
Enter player names or upload a text file with names separated by commas or lines.

### Table
Set the number of columns (sections), the minimum number of players who should be playing in a section, and the maximum additional number of players that can be added to that number, then click "fill table" to randomly generate an orchestration.

### Timing
1. "No cues" leaves timing/navigation up to the group.
2. "Player cues" uses a cueing technique stolen from the bassist-composer Lisle Ellis (and removed from the context of his wonderfully innovative and expansive graphic notation system): Clicking it randomly adds a thick border to cells indicating players whose entrance or departure cues that column.
3. "Timed cues" open up settings for an overall piece duration, and an option either even or uneven pacing, which is then shown by a slider.

## Notes

I have found this tool useful in practicing and exploring group improvisation. As with conduction, some musicians who value open improvisation hate constraints, and some hate grids, too. I get it. But constraints can also be generative, and grids can be very open. Have fun!
